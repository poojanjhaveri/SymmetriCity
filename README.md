=================================

Live : http://poojanjhaveri.com/symmetricity/

First of all, this project is final project submission for "Creative Programming for Digital Media & Mobile Apps" taken by Dr Marco Gillies, Dr Matthew Yee-King, Dr Mick Grierson on Coursera.
As a part of final project, this code is being developed by Poojan Jhaveri as an extension to SonicPainter provided by Mick, Marco and Matthew.And so, some of the code is used as a base to produce upon it.

Main Objective: Symmetricity is a web app to helps users create symmetrical patterns which can ultimately be used in designing web backgrounds or by graphic designers to generate designs.

Personal Motive: To implement fundamentals of creative programming learnt in “Creative Programming for Digital Media & Mobile Apps” (via Coursera) and to submit it as final project for the course.

Languages: HTML, Processing.js, javascript

Personal Project | June 2013 – July 2013

Project : Symmetricity is a Symmetric pattern generator. This application was created as a part of final project and as individual project for online course – “Creative programming for Digital Media and Mobile Apps” offered by University of London on Coursera. On front end – it uses HTML5 and javascript. While behind the scenes, creative programming is done using processing.js – JavaScript port of Processing, a programming language designed to write visualizations, images, and interactive content.

My Contribution and features of Symmetricity:

Design and develop web application using HTML, javascript and processing.js
Creative Programming by playing audio and drawing on canvas.
Allow generating background space of different size and color
Generate symmetric patterns automatically or using brushes manually.
Ability to capture the canvas – pattern and download the file.
Repeating the pattern across the screen to create a visual background effect.
